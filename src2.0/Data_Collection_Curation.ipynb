    "## Knowledge-Distilled LVM for Skeletal Disorder Screening\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Overview\n",
    "This dataset supports the development of a large vision model for gait-based screening of skeletal disorders, specifically adapted for Ugandan populations and resource-limited healthcare contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Composition\n",
    "**Total Videos: 256**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Category | Subcategory | Count | Total per Category |\n",
    "|----------|-------------|-------|-------------------|\n",
    "| **Disabled** | Assistive | 26 | 65 |\n",
    "| | NonAssistive | 39 | |\n",
    "| **Knee Osteoarthritis** | Early | 30 | 100 |\n",
    "| | Mild | 40 | |\n",
    "| | Severe | 30 | |\n",
    "| **Normal** | - | 60 | 60 |\n",

    "| | Severe | 5 | |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clinical Condition Distribution\n",
    "- **Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA)**: 39.1% of dataset\n",
    "- **Normal (Control)**: 23.4% of dataset  \n",
    "- **Disabled**: 25.4% of dataset\n",
    "- **Parkinson's Disease**: 12.1% of dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### Severity Stratification\n",
    "The dataset includes clinically relevant severity grading:\n",
    "- **KOA**: Early (30), Mild (40), Severe (30)\n",
    "- **Parkinson's**: Early (14), Mild (12), Severe (5)\n",
    "- **Disabled**: Assistive device usage (26) vs. Non-assistive (39)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Processing\n",
    "- **Pose Estimation**: MediaPipe for skeletal landmark extraction\n",
    "- **Output Format**: CSV files containing frame-by-frame landmark coordinates\n",
    "- **Data Representation**: 256 CSV files (one per gait video)\n",
    "- **Coordinate System**: 2D/3D skeletal keypoints with biomechanical relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Biomechanical Features Extracted\n",
    "- Joint angles and trajectories\n",
    "- Stride length and cadence measures  \n",
    "- Gait symmetry metrics\n",
    "- Trunk sway and postural alignment\n",
    "- Assistive device impact quantification\n",
    "- etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Strengths\n",
    "1. **Clinical Relevance**: Severity-graded conditions enable progressive disease modeling\n",
    "2. **Real-world Diversity**: Includes assistive device usage scenarios\n",
    "3. **Control Group**: Substantial normal gait samples (n=60) for baseline comparison\n",
    "4. **Multi-condition Coverage**: Addresses multiple skeletal disorders as outlined in project abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations & Considerations\n",
    "- **Parkinson's Sample Size**: Severe PD category limited (n=5) - may require data augmentation\n",
    "- **Demographic Metadata**: [Age/gender distribution to be documented]\n",
    "- **Video Specifications**: [Resolution/frame rate consistency to be verified]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alignment with Project Objectives\n",
    "This dataset structure directly supports:\n",
    "- **Teacher Model Training**: Sufficient samples for KOA and disabled categories\n",
    "- **Severity Progression Analysis**: Early→Mild→Severe stratification\n",
    "- **Assistive Device Impact Study**: Unique differentiation in disabled category\n",
    "- **Multi-condition Screening**: Coverage of osteoarthritis, neurological, and musculoskeletal conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intended Use Cases\n",
    "1. Temporal sequence modeling of gait abnormalities\n",
    "2. Severity classification and progression tracking\n",
    "3. Assistive device usage detection and analysis\n",
    "4. Cross-condition gait pattern comparison\n",
    "5. Model distillation for low-resource deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ethical Considerations\n",
    "- Patient consent obtained under ethical approval\n",
    "- Data anonymization maintained throughout processing\n",
    "- Secure storage and processing protocols\n",
