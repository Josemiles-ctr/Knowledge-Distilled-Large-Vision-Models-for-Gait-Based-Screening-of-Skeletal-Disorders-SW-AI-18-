# üö® IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

## Why All Workflows Failed

Your GitHub Actions workflows are failing because **GitHub Secrets are not configured**.

The workflow is trying to:
1. Build a Docker image
2. Login to Docker Hub
3. Push the image

But it **fails at Step 2** because it can't login (missing credentials).

## ‚ö° Quick Fix (2 minutes)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create Docker Hub Token
Go to: https://hub.docker.com/settings/security
- Click "New Access Token"
- Name it "GitHub Actions"
- Select "Read, Write, Delete" permissions
- Generate and **copy the token**

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Add Secrets to GitHub
Go to: https://github.com/Josemiles-ctr/Knowledge-Distilled-Large-Vision-Models-for-Gait-Based-Screening-of-Skeletal-Disorders-SW-AI-18-/settings/secrets/actions

Add two secrets:
1. `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` = `josemiles`
2. `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` = (paste token from step 1)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Trigger Workflow Again
Push a change to main:
```bash
cd /home/otaijoseph/Desktop/GaitLab
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger workflow"
git push origin main
```

## ‚úÖ Result

Workflow will now:
- ‚úÖ Build Docker image
- ‚úÖ Login to Docker Hub
- ‚úÖ Push image to `docker.io/josemiles/gaitanalysis:latest`

Takes ~8-12 minutes for first build.

See `GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions.
